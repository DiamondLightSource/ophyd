Attempts to increase the number of PVs above 100 with 100Hz update rate resulted in failures of the
Python IOC (with no monitors).  Data rates did not appear to be altered by increasing the number of 
monitors on individual PVs (perhaps to be expected if the client is intelligent)

Results here also suggested that increasing the numer of monitors on the same PV did not alter the rate
of data.  I do not understand why increasing the number of monitors by a factor of 10 increased significantly 
the load on the server, as the data rate suggests the monitors did not result in additional traffic.


Conclusion
**********

The Python IOC appears to be close to its limit with 100 records at 100Hz even without any clients connecting.
There was a fair bit of instability, quite often ring buffer error messages occured when the client applications
were started or stopped.
These tests also do not verify that the 100Hz updates were received without loss by the clients as no verification
was made by the clients on the quantity or values received.
